# üó£Ô∏è Yeeter 

Yeeter is a social media platform that is similar to Twitter. Basically, you can yeet your thoughts out into the world and they disappear a short time later. The digital equivalent of a crazy person yelling on the street, but with extra steps! I built this as a way to learning ruby on rails development.
